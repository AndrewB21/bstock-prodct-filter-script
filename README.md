## EVGA B-Stock Product Filter Script
Simple script to filter products by text that the user can change using the input field.

You can set the script to automatically filter on page load by setting the variable filterOnLoad (line 18) to true (is false by default)

You can change the initial filter text by changing defaultFilterText (line 17) (is "RTX" by default);

Script should actually work on any product page on EVGA's website as they follow the same HTML format, but that's untested.
